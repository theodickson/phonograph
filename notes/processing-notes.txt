Processing stage:

Remove:
1. Extremely unpopular artists and tracks
2. Duplicate artists and tracks
3. Stupid artists and tracks (Baby Sleep Sounds, various artists, unofficial remixes, mashups etc)

Calculate:
1. Genres for artists (PCA)
2. Actual release dates

Notes on removing duplicates:
    Relatively straightforward for tracks - once you've found one just keep the most popular.
    The complicating situation is duplicates with non-matching groups. Though this is mitigated greatly by the REDUCE_GROUP procedure iirc.

    More tricky for artists - you have to decide whether to merge or just remove the duplicate.


The key for ongoing maintenance is having full transparency in the duplicate removal process.
This will allow for calculation of quality metrics later on.

This is especially true as the data will be much messier than before due to no referencing of MusicBrainz for removing shit artists.

Therefore the cleanup model should at least start straightforwardly, and be relatively brutal.

On balance, merging artists is just too complicated and probably a bit pointless. It also destroys the elegance of the processing stage as a mere filter (with extra info calculated for existing entities)

Ideally, then, we could:
    Filter our unpopular artists and tracks
    Remove obviously shit artists (what to do with an artist's albums if the artist is removed?)
    Remove obviously shit albums (compilations etc)
    Remove obviously shit tracks

    Remove other duplicate tracks group-by-group
    Then maybe perform neighbourhood-based duplicate artist removal

    Add proper release dates
    Add artist genres
