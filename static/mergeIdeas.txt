Two type of merge:
	Straight merge:
		a1, a2: pop(a1) > pop(a2)
		If name(a2)<name(a1), take name(a2) otherwise, take name(a1)
		Assign all of a2's tracks to a1.
		Replace all neighbour mentions of a2 with a1.
		mergemapper[a2] = a1
		Delete a2
	Splitter merge:
		a1,a2: a2 = 'a1&a3'
		splitmergemapper.setdefault(a2, set([])).update(a1)
		Assign all of a2's tracks to a1.



For each track:
	Do previous merges on artists.
	Determine which artists have splitters.
	If none:
		For each artist:
			Find merges.
			If none:
				Store.
		Store track.
	Else:
		For each name with splitters:
			For each other name:
				Find merges.
